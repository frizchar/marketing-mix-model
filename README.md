### Overview
Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical forecasting technique designed to assess how different marketing strategies influence product sales. It employs statistical methods, such as multivariate regression analysis, on sales and marketing time-series data to quantify the effects of various marketing tactics. Typically, MMM is used to optimize the allocation of advertising and promotional efforts with the goal of maximizing sales, revenue, or profit, thereby enhancing return on investment. This approach enables marketers to simulate different scenarios and make data-driven decisions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their marketing spend.
